 <p><span lang=EN-US>The WHATINFOAON site is a site that connects users that are looking to purchase information (\u201cInformation Requester\u201d) and users that are looking to provide information (\u201cInformation Provider\u201d). Depending on the situation, the site users (\u201cUser\u201d) can become Information Requesters or Information Providers. The Terms of Use apply to Information Requests and Information Providers and naturally all users browsing the Site.</span></p> \
 <p><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p> \
 <p><span lang=EN-US>The Information Requester will post a question in the area or field of interest, and they will set a reward amount that will be paid out when a response is chosen. In order to receive the most satisfactory response, the question must have a clear field of interest and be specific. While the question is being processed and answered, the Information Requester must reserve or deposit the reward funds onto the Site and you agree to WHATINFOAON holding this amount.</span></p> \
 <p><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p> \
 <p><span lang=EN-US>The Information Provider confirms that the question\u2019s field of interest is in his or her specialty, and they will provide a response if they deems that the scope of the question is appropriate with the information that they can provide. All output must have intellectual property rights, and in the case there is a case of intellectual property right infringement, they must take all legal responsibility.</span></p> \
 <p><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p><p><span lang=EN-US>When the Information Requester finds a satisfactory response and chooses it, they will express their intent to send the reward amount. Throughout this process, you can supplement the content of the question or ask additional questions. All information can be obtained and secured once the reward has been paid out. The reward amount quoted by the Information Requested is transferred to the Information Provider through the Site\u2019s system in a point format.</span></p> \
